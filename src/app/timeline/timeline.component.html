        After gaining experience after a few years at Odense's beloved Nelle's Filosoffen Café, I was entrusted with the role of Store Manager at their top-performing location.
        I managed a team of 15 employees including everything from shift scheduling to inventory purchasing, hiring new team members, and having the overall responsibility for the café's operations.
        I loved my time at Nelle's which truly was a highlight of my life. At the same time it fostered professional and personal growth as a young leader, for becoming more focused and driven towards goals i set for myself.

          I've always been passionate about tech and dreamt of working in the industry.
          After some years of developing myself personally and gaining experience in the workforce, I enrolled at SDU for a degree in Software Technology. (BEeng in Software Technology) 
          I am currently in my 4th semester, and while the program can be tough in many aspects, it's also incredibly rewarding.
          Ultimately, I am enjoying my time at SDU and learning a lot in the process.

         This has been a great experience so far, allowing me to contribute to Grand Hotel's great reputation.
